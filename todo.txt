=================

    + top
        - site put & get need Workflow like submit() - see also venv wrapper, Local, IBM
        - reverse args of put & get
        - metadata notate on get?
        - test01: find by metadata, workflowId

        - capture runArgs, jobDefn in job status; show in workflow dump
        - lwfManager / logger set context (109)
        - logging provenance (107) - workflow level, job level - how to divine the context?
    + 2nd
        - import/export (#73)
        - submit & jobDefn take dict, list, or serialized string of either
        - todo items (many are for log context - separate ticket)
        - inline docs esp. for .base & .midware (#84), keywords, pillars for metasheet search
    + other
        - qtsuite test04: sqd
        - "data site" interface

+ IBM site driver, quantum info
    - get without a file involved - just a string return
    - proper job status emits
    - VSCode linting
    - unpacking qiskit results - show in qtsuite cfd
    - ibm site w qiskit run options - which besides those below?
    - notating get from IBM by doing a local put?
    - allow 1 session for many circuits
    - noise model, from backend
    - capture of current machine state
    - gpu device
    - custom pass manager steps
    - document driver


******************************************************************************
Design: (map to IBM 4-step process)

+ Author
    - describe circuit in language of choice (e.g. QASM, OpenQASM, etc.)
    - writes to descriptor format?

+ Pre 

+ Build (circuit_HHL.py)
    - construct circuit from description (likely Python Qiskit or matrix)
    - write to interchange format (Qpy)

+ Optimize

+ Transpile 

+ Run (solver.py)
    - reads in circuit in interchange format (Qpy)
    - transpiles / optimizes circuit (to ISA)  - is this two steps? what are ins/outs?
    - runs circuit 
    - returns results 
    + backend plugins
        - credentials (Auth)
        - libraries (Run)
        - execution (Run)
        - monitor execution (Run)
        - return results (Run)

+ Post
