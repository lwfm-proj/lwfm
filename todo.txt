Todo & misc notes
=================

******************************************************************************

+ IBM site driver, quantum info
    - send terminal status in submit on error
    + run prov
        - capture of current machine state
        - noise model, from backend, etc.
        - set logger context, submit/put/get
        - other qiskit run options, compiler passes
    + data prov
        - notating get from IBM by doing a local put?
        - metadata on get(), Workflow on get()/put()
        - get without a file involved - just a string return
        - unpacking qiskit results - show in qtsuite cfd


+ lwfm 2nd
    - clearing out stale remote monitoring jobs - test the gui
    - todo items (many are for log context - separate ticket)
    - normalize INFO logging data structure for job provenance, data provenance
    - lwfManager exec inline needs a way to handle runArgs for submit
    - lwfManager.dumpWorkflow() - all meta info of all kinds
    - test: do we handle jobDefn.getJobArgs() correctly for both data types? 
    - do we need submit() to take a list[str] in addition to dict for args?
    - utility functions for site drivers which takes objects of different types 
        which are potentially serialized and returns them in a set form - submit,get,put
    - more granular "find event" method in lwfm and get IBM driver submit() to use it


******************************************************************************
Design: (map to IBM 4-step process)

+ Author
    - describe circuit in language of choice (e.g. QASM, OpenQASM, etc.)
    - writes to descriptor format?

+ Pre 

+ Build (circuit_HHL.py)
    - construct circuit from description (likely Python Qiskit or matrix)
    - write to interchange format (Qpy)

+ Optimize

+ Transpile 

+ Run (solver.py)
    - reads in circuit in interchange format (Qpy)
    - transpiles / optimizes circuit (to ISA)  - is this two steps? what are ins/outs?
    - runs circuit 
    - returns results 
    + backend plugins
        - credentials (Auth)
        - libraries (Run)
        - execution (Run)
        - monitor execution (Run)
        - return results (Run)

+ Post
