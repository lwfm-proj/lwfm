Todo & misc notes
=================

******************************************************************************

+ examples
    + lwfm
        - metadata notate on get?
        - job trigger workflow reference is wrong
        - workflow dump job list, metasheets

        + find 
            - find workflow by metadata

        + logging 


    + slides
        - goals
        - history
        - framework: 3 tiers, 4 pillars
        - many similar to - nat lab round & round, FAIR
        - future work: import/export, full trigger impl, gui; ibm-specific

    - test04: sqd


+ lwfm
    + top
        - lwfManager / logger set context
        - cascading metadata sheet dump
        - test01: find by metadata, workflowId
        - email job status lifecycle & link to workflow
        - explicit workflow saving - lwfManager.saveWorkflow()
        - move test cases to qtsuite?
    - remove hardcoded site.toml
    - import/export (#73)
    - submit & jobDefn take dict, list, or serialized string of either
    - metasheets/jobs by xxx (#107)
    - reverse args of put & get
    - logging provenance - workflow level, job level - how to divine the context?
    - todo items (many are for log context - separate ticket)
    - inline docs esp. for .base & .midware (#84), document keywords, pillars for metasheet search
    - slurm interop?
    - better error message when site name is bum on getSite()


+ IBM site driver
    - get without a file involved - just a string return
    - proper job status emits
    - VSCode linting
    - unpacking qiskit results - show in qtsuite cfd
    - ibm site w qiskit run options - which besides those below?
    - notating get from IBM by doing a local put?
    - allow 1 session for many circuits
    - noise model, from backend
    - capture of current machine state
    - gpu device
    - custom pass manager steps
    - document driver



******************************************************************************
Design: (map to IBM 4-step process)

+ Author
    - describe circuit in language of choice (e.g. QASM, OpenQASM, etc.)
    - writes to descriptor format?

+ Pre 

+ Build (circuit_HHL.py)
    - construct circuit from description (likely Python Qiskit or matrix)
    - write to interchange format (Qpy)

+ Optimize

+ Transpile 

+ Run (solver.py)
    - reads in circuit in interchange format (Qpy)
    - transpiles / optimizes circuit (to ISA)  - is this two steps? what are ins/outs?
    - runs circuit 
    - returns results 
    + backend plugins
        - credentials (Auth)
        - libraries (Run)
        - execution (Run)
        - monitor execution (Run)
        - return results (Run)

+ Post
