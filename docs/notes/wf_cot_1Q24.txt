I would like some help decomposing a workflow into sub-tasks.  My workflow is this: I want to move a large file from my lab to the remote HPC cluster and when its complete, I want to run OpenFOAM on it using parameters contained in another small file here on my lab machine. The HPC cluster uses slurm and I the job to run at most 2 hours. When its done I want to move the large result file back to my lab machine and be notified by email that its complete.

Breaking down your workflow into sub-tasks can help manage each step more efficiently and ensure that the whole process is completed smoothly. Here's a possible decomposition of your workflow:

1. Preparation of Files
Sub-task 1.1: Ensure the large file is ready for transfer. This could involve compressing the file if it's not already in a compressed format to speed up the transfer.
Sub-task 1.2: Ensure the parameters file that will be used with OpenFOAM is prepared and ready for transfer.
2. Transfer Files to HPC Cluster
Sub-task 2.1: Use a secure file transfer method (such as SCP or rsync) to move the large file from your lab machine to the HPC cluster.
Sub-task 2.2: Transfer the small parameters file using the same method.
3. Setup for Running OpenFOAM
Sub-task 3.1: Log into the HPC cluster and locate the transferred files.
Sub-task 3.2: Load necessary modules or software environments needed for OpenFOAM, if not already set up on the HPC cluster.
Sub-task 3.3: Prepare a script to run OpenFOAM with the parameters from the small file. This involves:
Writing a shell script that loads the OpenFOAM environment, and then
Executes the OpenFOAM simulation using the parameters specified in the small file.
4. Submit Job to Slurm
Sub-task 4.1: Create a Slurm job script that specifies:
Job name, output file names, and error file names.
The maximum runtime (2 hours in your case).
The required computational resources (CPUs, memory, etc.).
The command to run the shell script prepared in Sub-task 3.3.
Sub-task 4.2: Submit the job to Slurm using the sbatch command.
Sub-task 4.3: Optionally, check the job status using squeue or similar commands to ensure it's running as expected.
5. Transfer Results Back to Lab Machine
Sub-task 5.1: Once the job completes, compress the result files if needed to speed up the transfer.
Sub-task 5.2: Transfer the compressed result file(s) back to your lab machine using SCP or rsync.
6. Notification of Completion
Sub-task 6.1: Prepare a script on the HPC cluster that sends an email notification upon completion of the result file transfer. This can be done using the mail command or any scriptable email tool, incorporating the job completion status and any relevant information.
7. Automation and Monitoring
Sub-task 7.1: Consider automating the workflow with a master script or using workflow management tools that can handle dependencies between tasks, especially if this is a recurring task.
Sub-task 7.2: Implement logging for each step to monitor the progress and troubleshoot any issues that might arise.
This breakdown should help you manage each aspect of your workflow more effectively. Each sub-task can be further detailed or adjusted based on specific requirements or constraints of your lab environment and the HPC cluster's configuration.

        """

# Workflow definition
rule all:
    input:
        "notification_sent"
Step 2: Configuration and Execution
SSH Configuration: Ensure you have passwordless SSH access set up to your HPC cluster for seamless execution of scp and ssh commands within the Snakemake rules.

Email Configuration: Adjust the send_notification rule according to your available email sending method. The example uses the mail command, which might require setup or replacement with another tool like sendmail or an SMTP client command.

Job Script Preparation: The run_simulation rule assumes you have a job script (job_script_on_hpc.sh) on the HPC that loads necessary modules, sets up the environment for OpenFOAM, and runs it with the specified parameters. You'll need to create this script according to your HPC's specifications and OpenFOAM requirements.

Execution: Run the workflow by navigating to the directory containing the Snakefile and executing snakemake --cores [number_of_cores]. Replace [number_of_cores] with the number of cores you wish to allocate for tasks that can be run in parallel (this example does not specifically include parallel tasks but Snakemake supports this).

This example is a starting point and will need to be adjusted to fit your specific environment, file paths, and HPC cluster setup. Snakemake is highly flexible and allows for complex workflows to be defined, including error handling, retries, and parallel execution.

Can you write the job file in step 3 for me?

ChatGPT
Sure! The job script for running an OpenFOAM simulation on an HPC cluster using Slurm (sbatch) needs to specify several Slurm directives for job scheduling, load necessary modules for OpenFOAM, and execute the OpenFOAM simulation with your parameters. Below is a basic template for such a script. You will need to adjust this script based on the specific OpenFOAM version you're using, the computational resources required for your simulation, and any module loading or environment setup specific to your HPC cluster.

Example Slurm Job Script (job_script_on_hpc.sh)
bash
Copy code
#!/bin/bash

#SBATCH --job-name=openfoam_simulation
#SBATCH --output=openfoam_simulation_%j.out
#SBATCH --error=openfoam_simulation_%j.err
#SBATCH --time=02:00:00
#SBATCH --partition=standard
#SBATCH --nodes=1
#SBATCH --ntasks-per-node=1
#SBATCH --cpus-per-task=4
#SBATCH --mail-type=END,FAIL
#SBATCH --mail-user=your_email@example.com

# Load the OpenFOAM module (adjust as per your HPC environment)
module load openfoam

# Navigate to the directory containing your case (adjust the path)
cd /path/to/your/case/directory

# Optionally, prepare your environment (e.g., copying parameter files if needed)

# Run the OpenFOAM application with parameters (adjust the command according to your setup)
# This example uses simpleFoam as a placeholder; replace it with your actual solver
simpleFoam -file your_parameters_file

# Note: The command above assumes your parameters are to be passed via a file or some other means.
# Adjust it according to how your simulation is set up.
Customizing the Script
Job Parameters: The #SBATCH lines define job parameters such as job name, output/error file locations, job duration (--time), and computational resources (nodes, CPUs). Adjust these according to your simulation's requirements and the policies of your HPC cluster.
Module Loading: The module load openfoam command is a placeholder. You'll need to replace it with the actual command to load the OpenFOAM environment on your HPC system. This might include loading specific versions of OpenFOAM or other dependencies.
Running the Simulation: The command to run OpenFOAM (simpleFoam -file your_parameters_file) is an example. Replace simpleFoam with the actual OpenFOAM solver you're using, and adjust the command line options to suit how your simulation is configured.
Execution
Submit this job script to Slurm using the sbatch command:

bash
Copy code
sbatch job_script_on_hpc.sh
This will queue the job for execution. You can use squeue to check the status of your job and scancel to cancel it if necessary. Once the job is submitted, Slurm will handle its execution according to the cluster's scheduling policies, running your OpenFOAM simulation with the specified parameters.

show me an example of using snakemake to upload the two files in parallel, then make the running of the openfoam job contingent on the asynchronous completion of the upload.
ChatGPT
To demonstrate using Snakemake for uploading two files in parallel and then running an OpenFOAM job contingent on the completion of those uploads, we'll modify the workflow to include parallel file transfer tasks and ensure the OpenFOAM simulation starts only after both transfers are completed. This involves using Snakemake's ability to handle task dependencies effectively.

Step 1: Define Rules for Parallel File Uploads
We will define two separate rules for uploading the large file and the parameters file to the HPC cluster. These rules will execute in parallel, thanks to Snakemake's dependency resolution.

Step 2: Define Rule for Running OpenFOAM Simulation
This rule will depend on the successful completion of both upload tasks. Only when both files are uploaded will Snakemake trigger the OpenFOAM simulation job.

Example Snakemake Workflow
Here's how the Snakefile can be structured:

python
Copy code
# Define file paths
local_large_file = "path/to/your/large_file"
parameters_file = "path/to/your/parameters_file"
remote_directory = "user@hpc:/path/to/remote/directory"
simulation_done_flag = "simulation_done"

# Rule for uploading the large file
rule upload_large_file:
    input:
        local_large_file
    output:
        touch("large_file_uploaded")
    shell:
        "scp {input} {remote_directory}"

# Rule for uploading the parameters file
rule upload_parameters_file:
    input:
        parameters_file
    output:
        touch("parameters_file_uploaded")
    shell:
        "scp {input} {remote_directory}"

# Rule for running OpenFOAM simulation on HPC (contingent on file uploads)
rule run_simulation:
    input:
        large_file_uploaded="large_file_uploaded",
        parameters_file_uploaded="parameters_file_uploaded"
    output:
        touch(simulation_done_flag)
    shell:
        """
        # Command to execute SSH and run a script on the HPC for submitting the job
        # This is a placeholder; replace with your actual command to submit the job
        ssh user@hpc 'sbatch /path/to/your/job_script_on_hpc.sh'
        """

# Final rule to define the target
rule all:
    input:
        simulation_done_flag
Explanation
Parallel Uploads: The upload_large_file and upload_parameters_file rules define tasks for uploading files to the HPC cluster. Snakemake will run these in parallel because they are independent of each other and both contribute to the requirements of the run_simulation rule.
Conditional Execution: The run_simulation rule is designed to wait for both the large_file_uploaded and parameters_file_uploaded signals (in the form of touch files) before proceeding. This ensures that the OpenFOAM simulation only starts after both files are successfully uploaded.
Execution: When you run Snakemake, it analyzes the dependency graph and realizes that run_simulation can only be executed after both uploads are complete, achieving the asynchronous completion requirement.
Running the Workflow
Execute the workflow with the following command:

sh
Copy code
snakemake --cores all
This tells Snakemake to use as many cores as available, allowing it to parallelize the file upload tasks.

Note
Make sure to replace placeholders like path/to/your/large_file, user@hpc, and /path/to/your/job_script_on_hpc.sh with actual paths and credentials relevant to your setup. Also, ensure that you have passwordless SSH access set up for the HPC cluster to allow seamless execution of scp and ssh commands within the Snakemake rules.
