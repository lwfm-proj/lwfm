# A "job status handler map" is a mapping of a canonical JobStatus state value to any callable handler function which takes a
# JobStatus arg.  Not all states need be represented with handlers.
# jobStatusHandlerMap: dict[JobStatusValues, callable]

# Terminal job states will execute the handler function one time. When the job moves to a terminal state, any remaining handlers
# for that job will be evicted.
# Non-terminal job states (e.g. INFO states) will execute the handler function once per unique occurance of the state.
# Only one handler may exist for each state.

# A "job status handler dictionary" is a set of "job status handler maps" indexed by jobId. This allows a O(1) lookup of the handler
# map for a given job, and O(1) lookup of the specific callable for that job state value.

# Changes to the "job status handler dictionary" should be written to a backing persistence.  Changes include: adding of a new
# handler map for a specific job, removing a handler map (when the job moves to a terminal state), updating the last instance
# identifier for a job & job status for non-terminal states (e.g. keeping track of the last and/or every "INFO" seen to notice a
# unique instance).
#
# So our conceptual data structure is: jobStatusHandlerDict: dict[str,dict[JobStatusValues,callable]]
# Plus the list of distinct JobStatus records (their ids) for non-terminal states which were previously seen and handled.
# This permits us to not be listening for job status coninuously (e.g. our laptop lid is closed) and then at some point
# catch up, executing the handlers for state changes not previously seen and handled.
#
# Conceptually, the key str to this handler dict could be a wildcard: "handler map for all jobs", "handler map for all jobs for a
# given site".
