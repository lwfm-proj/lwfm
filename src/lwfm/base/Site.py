    Run: in its most basic "MVP-0" form, the Run subsystem provides a mechanism to submit a job, cancel the job, and interrogate
    the job's status.  The submitting of a job might, for some Sites, involve a batch scheduler.  Or, for some Sites (like a "local"
    Site), the run might be immediate.  On submit, the method returns a JobStatus, which for immediate execution might be a terminal
    completion status.  A job definition (JobDefn) is a description of the job.  Its the role of the Site's Run subsystem to
    interpret the abstract JobDefn in the context of that Site.  Thus the JobDefn permits arbitrary name=value pairs which might be
    necessary to submit a job at that Site.  The JobStatus returned is canonical - the Site's own status name set is mapped into the

        Submit the job for execution on this Site.  It is an implementation detail of the Site what that means - everything

        asynchronous.  We would assume all Sites would implement this method.  Note that "compute type" is an optional member
        of JobDefn, and might be used by the Site to direct the execution of the job.

        [We note that both the JobDefn and the JobContext potentially contain a reference to a compute type.  Since the Job Context
        is historical, and provided to give that historical context to the job we're about to run, its strongly suggested that
        Site.Run implementations use the compute type named in the JobDef, if the concept is present at all on the Site.  We note also
        that compute type and Site are relatively interchangeable - one can model a compute resource as a compute type, or as its
        own Site, perhaps with a complete inherited Site driver imp]ementation.  e.g. NerscSiteDriver has two trivially subclassed
        Sites - one for Cori (rest in peace) and one for Perlmutter.  This could have been impleted as one Site with two compute
